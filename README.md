# Local RAG Based PDF Q&A
This project can help you query within your documents. No privacy problem, nothing, everything local.
You can modify and use your own local LLM model for embeddings and querying the PDFs. 

Note: This uses mxbai for embeddings and gemma3:1b for showing the results.

# To use this:
1. Clone the repository
2. Change the desired LLM in llm.py.
3. If you want to change the prompt you can do that too.
4. Run the command streamlit run app.py
